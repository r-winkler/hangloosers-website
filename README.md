# Hacks

stellar.js needs jquery 2.2.4 in order that it works properly. Newer versions of jquery caused stellar.js to throw exceptions. Also note following issue of stellar.js: https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js/issues/89 Two lines (435 and 436) in stellar.js have to be edited manually as mentioned in the comment.
